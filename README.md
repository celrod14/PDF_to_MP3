# PDF_to_MP3
This python code converts a PDF file to MP3. This allows users to listen to a PDF rather than read one. 

To compile on windows 'py main.py'

Make sure to name the pdf you want converted to 'book.pdf' or change the code accordingly. 

The script converts each page of the pdf into separate MP3 files.
